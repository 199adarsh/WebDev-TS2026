Design and develop a story-driven, cinematic frontend website for a technology event named “Tech Symposium”. The website should feel like a guided narrative experience, inspired by Apple’s design philosophy—minimal, calm, premium, and intentional. The layout should avoid clutter and dashboards, instead unfolding the story of the event as the user scrolls.

Use Bento UI layouts sparingly, only where structured grouping enhances clarity (such as highlights, featured events, sponsors, or team members). Most sections should be editorial and narrative, not card-based.
